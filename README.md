# Elf-EDTASM
1802 ROM-based editor/assembler

This Mike Riley's EDTASM with a few patches from a few people. In particular, though, this version accepts tabs in assembly input so you can say:

```
top:  inc  rf
      br top
```
Or, you can still do it the old say:
```
top: inc rf
 br top
```
(single spaces instead of tabs)
